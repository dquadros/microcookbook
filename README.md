# microcookbook
The MicroPython Cookbook - a collaborative effort

## Purpose
To create materials to help people use MicroPython.
The materials should be open source, and the book should be published by the team, not by a traditional publisher.

## Ideas
If you want to talk about something, put it [here](https://github.com/holdenweb/microcookbook/blob/main/brainstorm.md) and tell people!

## Tasks
The first task is to produce a draft outline.

## Introductions
Contributors should introduce themselves [here](https://github.com/holdenweb/microcookbook/blob/main/introductions.md).

The MicroPython Cookbook - a collaborative effort

## Purpose
To create materials to help people use MicroPython.
The materials should be open source, and the book should be published by the team, not by a traditional publisher.

## Ideas
If you want to talk about something, put it here and tell people!

## Tasks
The first task is to produce a draft outline.
